My GitHub Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project showcases my skills in web development, Python programming, and building applications using Flask and Django. Below is an overview of the tasks and the major project included in this repository.
Major Project: AI Chatbot
The centerpiece of this repository is an AI-powered chatbot. This chatbot leverages natural language processing to engage in conversations, answer questions, and assist users. Key features include:

Conversational AI: Responds intelligently to user inputs.
Customizable: Easily extensible to add new functionalities.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless front-end experience.

The chatbot is a culmination of my skills in integrating APIs, handling user inputs, and creating responsive web interfaces.
